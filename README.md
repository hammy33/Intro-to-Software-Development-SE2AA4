# Intro-to-Software-Development-SE2AA4
All assignments and coursework for my second year, Software Design I - Intro to Software Development course. Languages used are Python, Java and Latex. Assignments were completed by following a strict Module Interface Specification (MIS) that outlined the requirements of each module. The design and infrastructure of each assignment was then critiqued and tested following the implementation. I completed this course with a grade of 4.0.
